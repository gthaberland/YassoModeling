# Based on Yasso07 description Tuomi & Liski 17.3.2008
# Created by Taru Palosuo in December 2011


#  Instructions  IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

# 1) first run the source code for the function with "source(....r)"
# 2) then you can use the yasso07-function by just calling it yasso07.light(..)
# 3) Input needed for the function is the same as for the matrix version:
#        1. MeanTemperature - mean annual temperatures [C]
#        2. TemperatureAmplitude - temperature amplitudes [C] 
#        3. Precipitation - annual precipiations [mm]
#        4. InitialCPool - initial C pools of model compartments, length 5, [any unit]
#        5. LitterInput - mean litter input, 5 columns AWENH, [any unit]
#        6. WoodySize - size of woody litter (for non-woody litter this is 0)
#        7. Yasso07Parameters - these in the format applied in the fortran version, length 44
#        8. Time - simulation time 

# NOTE that this function eats only one type of material at the time. So, non-woody and different woody litter
# materials needs to be calculated separately.

# The output of the function is the matrix AWENH compartments at the given time since the simulation start


# Basics  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
